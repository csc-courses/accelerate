    "It is possible to realize parallel compution with a circuit consisting of computing units and wires connectin the units, or on a device such as a GPU that has a common memory accessible to multiple computing threads. In sorting networks, the computation consists of layers or either permutation of wires or a swap gate connecting two neighboring wires. The swap gate implements \n",

Since each layer is computed in unit time, either as a circuit or on a GPU, the time to sort is also $O((\\log n)^2)$. In the circuit model $O(n\\,(\\log n)^2)$ swap units are needed. In the GPU model, $O(n)$ threads are needed in each thead launch.\n",
