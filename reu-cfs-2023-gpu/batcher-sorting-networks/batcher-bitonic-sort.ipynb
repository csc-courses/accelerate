    "It is possible to realize parallel compution with a circuit consisting of computing units and wires connectin the units, or on a device such as a GPU that has a common memory accessible to multiple computing threads. In the sorting networks the only computation needed is a comparison and swap, which in the circuit model would realized in hardward, and in the GPU model realized in software. \n",

    "We will visualize the algorithm in the circuit model where wires carry values to and from computation units, the units arranged in layers and the data flow occuring at a consant one unit of time per layer (flowing from left to right). To implement such a circuit on a GPU, queue a kernel launch for each layer, with one thread assigned to each computation unit in that layer. Learning from the thread ID the wire on which the computation acts is the GPU programs job.\n",

    "_Given a bitonic sequence, split the sequence into halves such that each half is bitonic and all numbers in the first half are at least as large as any number in the second half._\n",

    "Then a recursion is possible until the bitonic sequence as output is of size 1. To complete the sort, one builds recursively upwards from an input of size 2, then 4, then 8, etc. These are arranged however so that the subcircuits alternate largest first or smallest first. This way, when paired, the sequence is bitonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of biotonic is nuanced. It says that for some rotation the sequence is moves in a direction, asecending or descending, that changes direction at most once. A sort sequence is bitonic, and so is a concatenation of an a sequence assorted upwards with a sequence assorted downwards. \n",
