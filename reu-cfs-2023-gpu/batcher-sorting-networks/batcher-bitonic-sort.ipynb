    "In a 1968 report, Ken Batcher presented two sorting networks that have $O((\\log n)^2)$ layers. Since each layer is computed in unit time, either as a circuit or on a GPU, the time to sort is also $O((\\log n)^2)$. In the circuit model $O(n\\,(\\log n)^2)$ swap units are needed. In the GPU model, $O(n)$ threads are needed in each thead launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Batcher's _Bitonic Sort_ is made up of units of swaps on the following principle,\n",
    "\n",
    "_Given a bitonic sequence, split the sequence into halves such that each half is bitonic and all numbers in the first half are at least as large as any number in the second half._\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a recursion is possible until the bitonic sequence as output is of size 1. To complete the sort, one builds recursively upwards from an input of size 2, then 4, then 8, etc. These are arranged however so that the subcircuits alternate largest first or smallest first. This way, when paired, the sequence is bitonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of biotonic is nuanced. It says that for some rotation the sequence is moves in a direction, asecending or descending, that changes direction at most once. A sort sequence is bitonic, and so is a concatenation of an a sequence assorted upwards with a sequence assorted downwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a sequence can ascend, descend and then ascend again and still be bitonic, if it is possible to rotate the sequence such that the two ascending sections can be merged.\n",
