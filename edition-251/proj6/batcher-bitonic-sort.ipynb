    "In a 1968 report, Ken Batcher presented two sorting networks that have $O((\\log n)^2)$ layers. Since each layer is computed in unit time, either as a circuit or on a GPU, the time to sort is also $O((\\log n)^2)$. In the circuit model $O(n\\,(\\log n)^2)$ swap units are needed. In the GPU model, $O(n)$ threads are needed in each thead launch.\n",

    "The definition of biotonic is nuanced. It says that for some rotation the sequence is moves in a direction, asecending or descending, that changes direction at most once. A sort sequence is bitonic, and so is a concatenation of an a sequence assorted upwards with a sequence assorted downwards. \n",

    "\n",
    "When the input bitonic sequence has no or one change, or if there are two changes but both changes occur in the first half or the second half of the sequence, the output is either the same as the input, or the top and bottom halves exchanged, with gives the correctness for the sorting order between top and bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final case is where there is exactly one change in the first half and exactly one change in the second half. It is helpful to figure out whether overall there are more 0's than 1's, more 1's than 0's, or they are equal.\n",

    "In the case of equality, the result is two constant halves; otherwise consider which is fewer and there will be a bitonic sequence mixes those with the majoriy value in one of the halves, the other have being constant the majority value. And the sorting property will be correct.\n",
